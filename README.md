# Lottoritter
Lottoritter is a gambling platform which supports multiple lotteries. On Lottoritter you can play real lotteries WITHOUT
SPENDING ANY money. This project is written in Java and is using the JavaEE 8 standard technology stack (EE4J).

The tech stack further includes [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) as backend storage with
[MongoDB-Morphia](https://mongodb.github.io/morphia/) as Java Object Document Mapper. The frontend is based on JSF and
JavaScript. The project is completely independent from any application server.

platform. See some features below.
